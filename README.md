# Degrees
This is a Python program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are according to the associated csv files. Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each other. Run the python program "degress.py" to explore. If you like my program, please follow me on GitHub, I will be grateful.
